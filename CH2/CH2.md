# Chapter 2.0
As described earlier, this book is going to take a very project-oriented perspective on teaching Python programming.
We will use "projects" to teach the important concepts about the Python language and computer programming in general.
At the beginning, these projects will be very simple.<br><br>
At the beginning of each chapter, we will list the projects we cover in each chapter, and the concepts that you
will learn about in that project.
<br><br>

#### Project 2.1: Input and output your favorite musicians
>Description: In project 2.1, you will learn to write a simple program that will ask you to enter your three 
favorite musicians. The program will then number them and print them out in the output window.
<br><br>
Learning Objectives:<br>
1\) Creating and running a python script<br>
2\) Creating and changing variables<br>
3\) Input from the Terminal<br>
4\) Output to the Terminal
<br><br>

#### Project 2.2: Read in a list of musicians and song titles from a file.
**Description**: In project 2.2, you will learn to write a simple program that will ask you to enter your three 
favorite musicians. The program will then number them and print them out in the output window.<br><br>
**Learning Objectives**:
- Read in data from a pre-existing file
- Learn about string data types and various operations you can perform on strings
- Output results to a new file
<br><br>

#### Project 2.3: Who was the is the most-listened to artist on Spotify in 2018?
**Description**: In project 2.3, you will start with two text files. File 1 has the ten most 
popular songs from Justin Bieber, and how often they were listened to on Spotify in 2018. File
2 has the same information from Kendirck Lamar. In this program you will read in both files, and 
compute which artist had more overall listens.<br><br>
**Learning Objectives**:
- Read in from a file
- Output to a file
