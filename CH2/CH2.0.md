# Chapter 2.0
As described earlier, this book is going to take a very project-oriented perspective on teaching Python programming.
We will use "projects" to teach the important concepts about the Python language and computer programming in general.
At the beginning, these projects will be very simple.
At the beginning of each chapter, we will list the projects we cover in each chapter, and the concepts that you
will learn about in that project.
